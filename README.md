## revshell

This is a simple script to automate the process of generating a reverse-shell command like those described in [pentestmonkey](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet) blog:

__Note:__ You can find a more updated and featured version of the `revshell.py` script [__here__](https://github.com/chrispetrou/shellback)!

## shconverter

This is a small script that takes as input an objdump output and extracts the shellcode:

## explorer

This script uses [`selenium`](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) with [chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) (_can work with other web-drivers also_) to open every url (_with a status code of 200_) from a [`dirsearch`](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch) output (_specified with --plain-text-report_):

## qrutils
Easily decode a QR code using [zxing online service](https://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx) or QR-encode a message using [qrencode](https://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/) utility:

## vtamper

Simple verb avalaibility/tampering checker. Using the `-i` switch it checks also for common header-vulnerabilities:

## dnz
This script uses [`dnspython`](http://www.dnspython.org/) to perform DNS zone transfers easily:

## irc
This script can be used as a template to built an automated IRC-bot using [`twisted`](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/) framework.

## fakeid
This script uses [fakenamegenerator.com](https://www.fakenamegenerator.com/) to generate a completely random person's id.
